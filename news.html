          <p>ONNX Runtime, a high-performance inference engine for machine learning models in the ONNX format, is now open source. ONNX Runtime is the first publicly available inference engine that fully implements the ONNX specification, including the ONNX-ML profile. Python, C#, and C APIs are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac. ONNX Runtime can deliver an average performance gain of 2X for inferencing. Partners in the ONNX community including Intel and NVIDIA are actively integrating their technology with ONNX Runtime to enable more acceleration.

          <p>ONNX.js, an open source Javascript library for running ONNX models on browsers and on Node.js, is now available. It allows web developers to score pre-trained ONNX models directly on browsers, and has adopted WebAssembly and WebGL technologies for providing an optimized ONNX model inference runtime for both CPUs and GPUs. ONNX.js is the first solution to utilize multi-threading in a Javascript-based AI inference engine (via Web Workers), offering significant performance improvements over existing solutions on CPU.

<p>These type annotations are used by mypy within the ONNX CI systems to ensure a continuously high code quality standard. 
We also have type annotations for our APIs, which means your tools built on top of the ONNX APIs can use static

            <p>In the beginning of the recent deep learning revolution, 
            researchers had only a handful of tools (such as Torch, Theano, and Caffe)
            to work with, but today there is a robust ecosystem of deep learning 
            frameworks and hardware runtimes. While this growing toolbox is 
            extremely useful, each framework has the potential to become an 
            island unto itself without interoperability. But interoperability 
            requires a lot of custom integration work for each possible 
            framework/runtime pair, and reimplementing models to move between 
            frameworks is typically difficult and can slow development by weeks 
            or months.

            <h3 class="headline">Announcing ONNX 1.0</h3>
            <p>
                Today, the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) working group, which includes Amazon Web Services (AWS), Facebook, and Microsoft, announces the availability of ONNX 1.0. This release introduces the stable and production-ready version of the ONNX format. ONNX is an open standard format for deep learning models that enables interoperability between deep learning frameworks such as Apache MXNet, PyTorch, Caffe2, and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit. ONNX 1.0 enables users to move deep learning models between frameworks, making it easier to put them into production. For example, developers can build sophisticated computer vision models using frameworks such as PyTorch and run them for inference using CNTK or Apache MXNet.
